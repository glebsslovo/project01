               <p class=" text-muted lh-4">News is a truly, concise and accurate report of the event. A news is the report of an event and what an event itself. News means the record of the event that has taken place in a particular era. The significant element of news is that it is an event in which some kind of action takes place. It is a report in which the action is described narrated, highlighted or recorded. News is written in a comprehensive manner. There should be one audience or a class of readership. To whom the description is to be presented in print or on the air or on T.V. or movie screen. News should provoke into recipients or at least some of them to thought or action.

                  <div class="col-lg-10 ">Zoë Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, explained: “Following a detailed consultation, it is clear that GambleAware and other organisations need to work together to achieve a society that is safe from gambling harms. 

                     “Thanks to greater certainty in funding, we are now able to develop and implement longer-term commissioning plans to work towards a society where fewer people experience gambling harms and ensure that those who do, receive timely and effective support.  
                     
                     “Over the next five years, we will work to build the accessibility and effectiveness of the National Gambling Treatment Service and ensure it is recognised as a strong coalition of treatment services and prevention activities, delivered in collaboration with the NHS and others. 
                     
                     “By 2026, we hope to have made significant progress towards our vision, but also want to ensure that these programmes will continue to be sustained beyond the five-year term of this strategy.”
                     
                     GambleAware has published its five-year organisational strategy, underpinned by four key objectives linked to awareness, inequalities, service capacity and access, which will guide a long-term vision of a society safe from gambling harms.
                     
                     These objectives include developing awareness and understanding of gambling harms; increasing access to services and reducing inequalities; building capacity among health and community services to respond better to gambling harms; and improving the coherence, accessibility, diversity, and effectiveness of the National Gambling Treatment Service.  
                     
                     Kate Lampard CBE, chair of trustees, explained: “Our vision is a society where everyone is protected from gambling harms, and that a greater proportion of those with gambling disorder will receive the right treatment with sustained recovery at rates comparable to other addictions and behavioural problems. 
                     
                     “To help make this a reality, it is essential to ensure gambling harms are clearly understood. It is also vital that the mechanisms for effective prevention are in place, and those who are experiencing harms are able to access the advice, support and treatment they need.”
                     
                     The charity says that financial commitments from the industry has enabled it to take a longer-term integrated and strategic approach to addressing gambling harms, which includes collaboration with the government, NHS, public health agencies, local authorities, and voluntary sector organisations.
                     
                     This approach, says GambleAware, is aimed at the delivery of a programme of work that demonstrates leadership in establishing, developing, and maintaining a coordinated network of services.
                     
                     GambleAware’s strategy also lists more than 40 programmes, across research, evaluation, education, and treatment to achieve its aforementioned ambitions.</div>

                  <div class="col-lg-10 ">The new partnership means Greentube’s online and mobile versions of iconic titles such as Sizzling Hot™, Book of Ra™, Lucky Lady’s Charm™ and Lord of the Ocean™ are now available as part of Slotegrator’s rapidly expanding casino portfolio. Slotegrator will use its APIgrator solution to quickly and seamlessly integrate Greentube’s extensive catalogue onto operator platforms.

                     Slotegrator, which has significant reach across markets in Eastern Europe, is a well-established software solution provider and aggregator for online casinos and sportsbooks. With its strong presence in Eastern Europe, Greentube will benefit by expanding its customer base across a region that forms a core part of its growth strategy, while both companies share a commitment to responsible gambling.
                     
                     The deal follows Greentube’s recent entry into Poland, with Germany and the Netherlands next on the agenda as both markets will start local licensing soon. Greentube’s growth trajectory will be backed by the launch of its new RGS platform later this year.

                     Greentube shares Slotegrator’s dedication to responsible gaming and the content aggregator goes above and beyond the regulations set in the many jurisdictions in which its games are licensed.
                     
                     Vadim Potapenko, Head of Sales at Slotegrator, said: “Here at Slotegrator we’re delighted to have Greentube on board, and we’re looking forward to bringing their games to our clients which are interested in high-quality and secure entertainment products.”
                     
                     Michael Bauer, CFO/CGO at Greentube, said: “The region of Eastern Europe is an important one for Greentube as we strive to expand our reach across regulated markets. Slotegrator is a content aggregator with an extensive track record of providing high quality content to operators through seamless integration. This partnership with such a well-respected company allows us to present our games to an extended audience.”</div>

                     Bhotesh Maheshwari, vice president of commercial strategy and operations at Pragmatic Play, added: “Our live casino offering continues to grow in popularity, and we’re delighted to take our games live across Novibet’s brands in regulated markets. 
                     
                     “We’ve experienced significant growth in this vertical and are delighted to welcome Novibet into the fold as a valued partner.”
                     
                     Pragmatic Play has struck an alliance with Novibet in a collaboration that will see its live casino offering launch across multiple regulated markets, including Greece and the United Kingdom.
                     
                     The igaming and sports betting operator, which says that it is striving to expand users’ playing tastes even further, becomes the latest in a string of live casino link-ups for the provider, which adds that it has witnessed “significant growth” in the segment.
                     
                     “Pragmatic Play has a well-deserved reputation as a leading multi-product provider and we’re very enthusiastic to realise this partnership,” noted Fotini Matthaiou, casino manager at Novibet.
                     
                     “Its thrilling live casino games open up new avenues for our players to enjoy their igaming experiences and we’re eagerly awaiting a strong future relationship together.”</div>
